    <h2>My Personal Interests & Hobbies</h2>

      <h3>Arts & Crafts</h3>

      <p class="description">
        Arts & Crafts are an essential outlet for creativity. I find that it takes my mind off work and allows me to 
        focus on the present. It's important to have a hobby which allows you to have your own time to focus on a 
        calming activity and recharge your mind.

        My recent works include painting and bedazzling a canvas, as well as a collage to put on my wall as decor.

      <h3>Tabletop Games</h3>
      <img src="images/tabletop-games.png" class="hobby-image" id="games-img" alt="A variety of tabletop games">
      <p class="description">
        Tabletop games like Monopoly and UNO have been staples since childhood. Honesly, whether I win or lose, the 
        competition keeps me engaged. Game nights are always pretty loud, competitive, and seriously memorable. The 
        break from all the screens, the bursts of collective laughter, and the unexpected victories make them special.
      </p>
      <h4 class="clear-list">Current Favorite Tabletop Games:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Speed - It's all about reflex and, well, speed.</li>
        <li>UNO - Simple rules (usually... Rules may vary by household), high chaos, and total social betrayal.</li>
        <li>Monopoly - Choose your cute token (I usually go with the cat), then enjoy collecting all the rent money.</li>
        <li>Guess Who? - I enjoy acting like a detective asking questions trying to solve the mystery.</li>
        <li>Egyptian Rat Screw - A high-energy, fast-paced game that is best when played with lots of people.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <img src="images/camera.png" class="hobby-image" id="camera-img" alt="Black modern mirrorless camera with lens">
      <p class="description">
        I wouldn't call myself a photographer, but I do enjoy capturing pictures of nature with my phone. I've always 
        liked taking pictures to capture the moment, but what got me back into it was an Art class in high school. The 
        class taught me skills like composition, how to manage lighting, and how to use the exposure triangle. For now, I 
        just use my phone as it's easily accessible when a spontaneous photo opportunity comes up, but I might look into 
        real cameras in the future to gain manual control over the settings.

      <h3>Baking</h3>
      <img src="images/cookies.png" class="hobby-image" id="cookies-img" alt="Baked chocolate chip cookies">
      <p class="description">
        Baking is a hobby I'm interested in getting more into as it can be kind of therapeutic. The aroma of vanilla and 
        brown sugar that fills the kitchen is just so comforting and relaxing. The satisfaction from making something that 
        is warm, delicous, and brings joy to my family is what makes the time spent measuring and mixing worth it.

      <h4 class="clear-list">My Baking Bucket List:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Dubai Chocolate Brownies
