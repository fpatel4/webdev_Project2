    <h1>Pinterest</h1>
    <h2>What is Pinterest?</h2>
    <p>
      Pinterest is essentially an app where you can "collect" and organize images and short videos. I use 
      it as my personal digital bulletin board to visualize plans, save ideas, and gain inspiration. Unlike other 
      popular apps, Pinterest is more of a discovery tool based entirely on images.

    <h3>Here's a Guide to Getting Started on Pinterest for Beginners</h3>

    <h2>What do you use the app for?</h2>
    <p>
      I mainly use Pinterest for visual planning by collecting Pins across a wide range of subjects. I create 
      dedicated boards for my interests, like a board for "Room Inspo" and then another for "Art Inspo", to keep 
      everything organized. But, I use it for more than just hobbies as I also maintain vision boards for future 
      goals, a board for things I want to buy, and even a board of pictures I find of cute animals. The organization 
      aspect is definitely Pinterest's greatest strength for me.
    </p>
    <h2>Why It's My Favorite App:</h2>
    <p>
      Pinterest's design prioritizes the functional use over the social aspect. While users can comment on Pins and 
      follow others, the platform's focus is on collecting and organizing ideas. Additionally, I like how creating 
      my own boards frees up mental energy. Ultimately, Pinterest is currently my favorite app on my phone because 
      it not only productively allows me to move from simple inspiration to organized, achievable projects, but 
      it's relaxing and enjoyable to do so.

    <h2>My Step-By-Step Process on Creating a New Board:</h2>
    <ol class="app-list">
      <li>
        First, I use the search bar to discover an interesting Pin or idea. (Ex: "Room decor ideas" or "Baking 
        recipes").
      </li>
      <li>
        After clicking on a Pin, I select the "Save" button.
      </li>
      <li>
        I then select "Create board" (usually located on the bottom of the screen) and give it a descriptive title 
        for future reference.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Pin is then saved to the new board.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, I continue the process, looking for other Pins and saving them to the newly created board.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Here are a few ideas for boards:</h3>
    <ul class="app-list">
      <li>Travel - Save destinations and packing lists</li>
      <li>Gift Ideas - Save ideas for presents for others</li>
      <li>Wants - Save ideas for things you want or hope to buy</li>
      <li>Baking - Save Pins featuring baked goods you want to make yourself</li>
      <li>Outfits - Save outfits so that you have ideas for future reference</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="conclusion-text">All in all, Pinterest is a great app that helps me organize different aspects of my life and gain inspiration, as well.</p>
